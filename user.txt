Locate the section labeled with any of the following synonyms:  
- `"servicing provider"`  
- `"physician"`  
- `"Therapist"`  
- `"Attending physician"`  
- `"Accepting physician"`  
- `"Rendering Provider"`  
 
- Extract the **City** from the Servicing Provider section **only if the section label is explicitly present**.  
- **Do not** extract from other sections.  
- If the label is missing or no City is found, return `""`.  
- Provide **bounding box coordinates** scaled to **1000 Ã— 1000 pixel range**.  

**Output Format:**  
```json
[{
  "key": "servicing_provider_city",
  "value": "<Extracted City>",
  "boundingBox": {
    "topLeftX": <xmin>,
    "topLeftY": <ymin>,
    "bottomRightX": <xmax>,
    "bottomRightY": <ymax>
  }
}]
```
**If no label is found or Provider City is missing:**  
```json
[{
  "key": "servicing_provider_city",
  "value": "",
  "boundingBox": {}
}]
```
